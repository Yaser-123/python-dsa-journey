# 🚀 Daily DSA Practice in Python

Welcome to my **Daily DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice** repository! This project is a testament to my commitment to mastering DSA concepts and sharpening my problem-solving skills through consistent, hands-on practice. Here, you'll find well-structured, professional Python solutions to classic and essential DSA problems—each file is crafted with clarity, efficiency, and learning in mind.


## 📂 Repository Structure
Each file is thoughtfully named to reflect the problem it solves, making navigation and reference easy:

- `001_Extraction_Of_Digits.py` – Extract digits from a number
- `002_Count_Of_Digits.py` – Count the number of digits in a number
- `003_Number_Is_Palindrome_Or_Not.py` – Check if a number is a palindrome
- `004_Armstrong_Number.py` – Check if a number is an Armstrong number
- `005_Factors_Of_Number.py` – Find all factors of a number
- `006_Frequency_In_Dictionary.py` – Find frequency of elements using a dictionary


## �️ How to Use
1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine.
2. **Explore** any Python file to review the code, logic, and approach for each problem.
3. **Run the scripts** using Python 3.x:
   ```powershell
   python <filename.py>
   ```
4. **Experiment and Learn!** Tweak the code, try new test cases, and deepen your understanding.


## 🎯 Goals & Motivation
- Practice and master DSA concepts **every single day** with passion and discipline.
- Build a robust foundation for coding interviews, technical assessments, and real-world problem-solving.
- Foster a growth mindset and a habit of continuous learning.
- Share knowledge and inspire others in the programming community.


## ⭐ Contributions & Community
While this repository is primarily for my personal growth, I encourage you to **fork, star, and use the code for your own learning journey**! If you have suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request—let's grow together as a community of passionate learners.
